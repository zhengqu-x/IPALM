# IPALM - Inexact Proximal Augmented Lagrangian Framework

This repository contains the implementation and experimental code for the paper:

**"An inexact proximal augmented Lagrangian framework with arbitrary linearly convergent inner solver for composite convex optimization"** by F. Li and Z. Qu.

## Overview

The IPALM package provides algorithms to solve composite convex optimization problems of the form:

```
minimize f(x) + g(x) + h(p(x))
```

where:
- `f(x)` is convex and differentiable on an open set containing dom(g)
- `g(x)` is proper, convex and closed
- `h(x)` is proper, convex and closed or an indicator function of a convex and closed set
- `p(x)` is a linear operator (matrix) or quadratic operator

## Problem Types Supported

1. **Basis pursuit**: `f(x) = 0`, `g(x) = Œª‚ÇÅ‚Äñx‚Äñ‚ÇÅ`, `h(x) = I_{x=b}`
2. **Least absolute deviation**: `f(x) = 0`, `g(x) = Œª‚ÇÅ‚Äñx‚Äñ‚ÇÅ`, `h(x) = Œª‚ÇÉ‚Äñx‚Äñ‚ÇÅ`
3. **Fused lasso**: `f(x) = 0.5‚ÄñAx - b‚Äñ‚ÇÇ¬≤`, `g(x) = Œª‚ÇÅ‚Äñx‚Äñ‚ÇÅ`, `h(x) = Œª‚ÇÉ‚Äñx‚Äñ‚ÇÅ`
4. **L‚ÇÅ norm support vector machine**: `f(x) = 0`, `g(x,w) = Œª‚ÇÅ‚Äñx‚Äñ‚ÇÅ`, `h(x) = max(0,1-x)`
5. **Quadratically constrained quadratic program**: `f(x) = 0.5x·µÄQ‚ÇÄx + b‚ÇÄx`, `g(x) = I_{-b ‚â§ x ‚â§ b}`, `h(x) = I_{x ‚â§ 0}`, `p(x) = (0.5x·µÄQ‚±ºx + b‚±ºx - 1)‚±º‚Çå‚ÇÅ,...,‚Çò`

## Reproducing Experimental Results

The repository includes detailed instructions for reproducing all figures and tables from the paper. Each experiment involves:

1. Running the C++ executable with specific parameters
2. Processing results with MATLAB visualization scripts

üìã **For complete experimental details and step-by-step reproduction instructions, see [EXPERIMENTS.md](EXPERIMENTS.md)**

### Example: Reproducing Figure 1(a)

```bash
cd IPALM
g++ -o main main.cpp -lgsl -lgslcblas

# Run experiments (takes ~4400 seconds total)
./main 2 a news20scale2 0.01 1 100000 800 1 100 100
./main 2 c news20scale2 0.01 1 100000 1200 1000 50
./main 2 d news20scale2 0.01 1 100000 1200 10
./main 2 e news20scale2 0.01 1 1000000 1200 0.1 100

# Generate plot
cd ../MATLAB_code
matlab -r "plot_news20scale2_lasso"
```

### Results Storage
- Experimental results are saved in `IPALM/results/`
- Generated plots are saved as EPS files in `MATLAB_code/myplots/`

## Dataset Information

### Standard Datasets
Most datasets are sourced from the [LIBSVM repository](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/):
- Classification: a7a-a9a, w4a-w8a, ijcnn1, covtype
- Text processing: news20scale2, news20binary, rcv1, rcv1mc

### Generated Datasets  
- `qcqp1`, `qcqp2`: Included in repository
- `qcqp3`, `qcqp4`: Generate using `CVX/qcqp_generate.m` (too large for upload)
- `real-sim`: Download separately from LIBSVM (too large for upload)

### Preprocessing Requirements
Some datasets require extraction:
```bash
# Unzip compressed datasets
unzip matrix_news20binary.zip
unzip matrix_news20binary_bp.zip  
unzip matrix_covtype.zip
```

## Performance Benchmarks

The package includes comprehensive performance comparisons across:
- 5 optimization algorithms
- 20+ benchmark datasets
- Multiple problem formulations (basis pursuit, fused lasso, SVM, QCQP)

Typical runtime expectations:
- Small problems (w4a, w6a): ~200-400 seconds per algorithm
- Medium problems (news20scale2, rcv1): ~600-2400 seconds per algorithm  
- Large problems (news20binary, real-sim): ~3600-14800 seconds per algorithm
